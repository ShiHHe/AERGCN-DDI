# AERGCN-DDI
Accurately identifying the risk level of drug combinations is of great significance in investigating the mechanisms of combination medication and adverse reactions. Most existing methods can only predict whether there is an interaction between two drugs, but cannot directly determine their accurate risk level. In this study, we propose a multi-class drug combination risk prediction model by using relational graph convolutional network with multi-head attention mechanism, named AERGCN-DDI. More specifically, drug-drug interaction events with different risk levels are modeled as a heterogeneous information graph. Then, we learn the attribute feature of drug nodes and links based on compound chemical structure information. Finally, the AERGCN-DDI model is proposed to predict drug combination risk level based on heterogenous graph neural network and multi-head attention modules. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, five-fold cross-validation and ablation study were conducted. Furthermore, we compared its predictive performance with baseline models and other state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrated that AERGCN-DDI achieves superior performances and can serve as a useful tool for predicting the risk levels of drug combinations, which can help guide clinical medication decisions, reduce serious drug side effects, and improve patient clinical prognosis.
